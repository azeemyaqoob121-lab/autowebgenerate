## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Universal Business Intelligence Engine

**Rationale:**
This is the foundation for everything else. Without accurately detecting business type and extracting existing content, the system cannot make intelligent design decisions. This solves the core problem of "generic templates" by enabling context-aware generation.

**Implementation Components:**

1. **Business Type Classifier Module** (`app/services/business_classifier.py`)
   - Input: Business category field + scraped website text content
   - Process: Keyword matching + pattern recognition
   - Output: Primary category (12 types) + confidence score + secondary tags
   - Example: "Joe's Pizza" → Restaurant (95% confidence) + Italian + Casual Dining

2. **Content Extraction Module** (`app/services/content_extractor.py`)
   - Logo detection and download
   - Color palette extraction (dominant colors from logo/existing site)
   - Text content extraction (about, services, testimonials)
   - Existing image inventory
   - Contact info validation

3. **Gap Analysis Module** (`app/services/gap_analyzer.py`)
   - Check mobile responsiveness (viewport meta, media queries)
   - Analyze design modernity (CSS framework detection, color trends)
   - Evaluate performance (estimated load time from page size)
   - Assess SEO basics (title, meta, headings, schema)
   - Identify missing sections (no testimonials, no contact form, etc.)
   - Output: Weakness report with priority scores

**Next Steps:**
1. Create `business_classifier.py` with 12-category mapping
2. Implement keyword-based classification algorithm
3. Test against 20 sample businesses across all categories
4. Integrate into existing template generation workflow
5. Update `template_generator_premium.py` to use classifier results

**Resources Needed:**
- Keyword database for each business category (200+ keywords)
- Sample websites for testing (20 diverse businesses)
- 2-3 days development time

**Timeline:** Week 1 - Foundation week

---

#### #2 Priority: Niche-Specific Design Rule Engine

**Rationale:**
Once we know the business type, we need intelligent rules to generate appropriate designs. This is what transforms a "template" into a "custom design." The morphological analysis matrix provides the complete blueprint - now we need to codify it into executable rules.

**Implementation Components:**

1. **Design Configuration System** (`app/config/niche_designs.yaml`)
   - YAML configuration file with design rules for each business type
   - Structure:
   ```yaml
   restaurant:
     primary_colors: ["#8B4513", "#D2691E", "#FFF8DC"]
     typography:
       heading: "Playfair Display, serif"
       body: "Open Sans, sans-serif"
     hero_style: "fullscreen_video"
     animation_intensity: "medium_high"
     required_sections: [hero, menu, about, gallery, reviews, reservation, location]
     primary_cta: "Reserve Table"
     secondary_cta: "View Menu"
     trust_signals: ["years_in_business", "chef_credentials", "reviews"]
     image_search_terms: ["fine dining", "restaurant interior", "food plating"]
     video_search_terms: ["restaurant ambiance", "cooking"]
   ```

2. **Template Assembly Engine** (`app/services/template_assembler.py`)
   - Takes business type + extracted content + design rules
   - Assembles sections in optimal order
   - Applies niche-specific styling
   - Injects appropriate CTAs
   - Outputs structured template data

3. **Component Library** (`app/templates/components/`)
   - Reusable HTML components for each section type
   - Parameterized (colors, fonts, content, animations)
   - Examples: hero_video.html, services_grid.html, testimonials_carousel.html, contact_form.html

**Next Steps:**
1. Create complete `niche_designs.yaml` with all 12 business types
2. Build `template_assembler.py` to read YAML and generate HTML structure
3. Create 8-10 reusable component templates
4. Test assembly with each business type
5. Integrate with premium template generator

**Resources Needed:**
- Complete design specifications for all 12 categories (use morphological analysis matrix)
- Component HTML/CSS library (50-80 hours design/dev work)
- Testing across business types

**Timeline:** Week 2-3 - Core design system

---

#### #3 Priority: Enhanced Media Sourcing with Niche Intelligence

**Rationale:**
Professional images and videos are what separate $500 websites from $50,000 websites. The current premium generator has media sourcing, but it needs niche-specific intelligence to fetch truly appropriate assets. This is the "wow factor" that makes business owners want to buy.

**Implementation Components:**

1. **Intelligent Search Query Generator** (`app/services/media_query_builder.py`)
   - Input: Business type + location + specific content section
   - Output: Optimized search queries for image/video APIs
   - Example:
     - Business: "Maria's Hair Salon" (Beauty/Wellness)
     - Section: Hero → Query: "modern hair salon interior", "hairstylist at work"
     - Section: Gallery → Query: "hair transformation", "salon styling", "hair color results"

2. **Image Quality Scoring** (`app/services/media_evaluator.py`)
   - Fetch multiple candidates for each image slot
   - Score based on: resolution, aspect ratio, color harmony, professionalism
   - Select best matches automatically
   - Fallback to placeholder if API fails or no quality matches

3. **Video Background System** (`app/services/video_backgrounds.py`)
   - Fetch niche-appropriate background videos (Pexels Video API)
   - Requirements: minimum 1920x1080, 10-30 seconds, loopable
   - Optimize: compress, mute, set autoplay/loop attributes
   - Fallback: high-quality hero image if video not available

4. **Asset Management** (`app/services/asset_manager.py`)
   - Cache fetched images/videos to avoid re-downloading
   - Store references in database media_assets JSONB field
   - Track Unsplash photographer credits (required by API terms)
   - Implement rate limiting to stay within API quotas

**Next Steps:**
1. Enhance existing `media_sourcing_service.py` with niche-intelligent query builder
2. Implement quality scoring algorithm for image selection
3. Add video background fetching capability
4. Test media sourcing for all 12 business types
5. Verify API rate limits and implement caching strategy

**Resources Needed:**
- Unsplash API key (free tier: 50 requests/hour)
- Pexels API key (free tier: 200 requests/hour)
- Storage for cached media assets
- 3-4 days development time

**Timeline:** Week 4 - Media excellence

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

1. **First Principles breakdown** revealed that "premium" is actually a combination of 5 fundamental pillars (visual, content, functionality, trust, technical) - not just "fancy animations"

2. **Morphological Analysis** created the complete blueprint for a universal system - the parameter matrix is the exact specification needed for implementation

3. **Recognizing the "Gap Analysis" approach** as key psychological factor - business owners need to see improvement, not replacement

4. **Understanding that niche-specificity is parameterizable** - we don't need separate systems for each business type, just intelligent rules

### Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Competitive intelligence** - Should we scrape competitor websites in the same niche/location to identify winning patterns?

2. **A/B testing strategy** - How to systematically test which design variations convert better for each business type?

3. **Client feedback loop** - How to capture business owner preferences and improve templates over time?

4. **Regional design differences** - Do UK businesses prefer different designs than US businesses?

5. **Seasonal adaptations** - Should restaurant websites change for holidays? Should HVAC sites emphasize heating in winter?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

1. **SCAMPER Method** - Apply to each business category to generate even more niche-specific innovations (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse)

2. **Six Thinking Hats** - Evaluate the proposed solution from multiple perspectives (facts, emotions, creativity, benefits, risks, process)

3. **Pre-Mortem Analysis** - Imagine the system failed - what went wrong? Use this to identify and prevent failure modes

### Questions That Emerged

1. How do we handle businesses that span multiple categories? (e.g., cafe + bookstore, gym + juice bar)

2. Should we allow business owners to manually override detected category if classifier is wrong?

3. What's the minimum viable version - can we launch with just 3-4 business types and expand?

4. How do we measure success - by Lighthouse score improvement? By business owner satisfaction? By conversion rates?

5. Should generated websites be editable by business owners, or locked to maintain quality?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:**
  - Technical architecture deep-dive for implementation
  - Database schema design for niche configurations
  - API integration strategy for media sourcing
  - Testing framework for template quality assurance

- **Recommended timeframe:** 1 week after implementation begins (to address real-world challenges)

- **Preparation needed:**
  - Have `business_classifier.py` prototype working
  - Test with 5 sample businesses
  - Document any unexpected challenges or insights

## Quick Start Implementation Guide

**For the developer implementing this system:**

**Step 1: Install/Verify Prerequisites**
```bash
# Ensure aiohttp is installed (required for premium generator)
venv\Scripts\pip.exe install aiohttp

# Verify premium generator is active in routes
# Check: businesses.py line 22 and templates.py lines 16-20
# Should import from template_generator_premium
```

**Step 2: Create Business Classifier** (Priority #1)
```python
# File: backend/app/services/business_classifier.py

CATEGORY_KEYWORDS = {
    "restaurant": ["restaurant", "cafe", "dining", "food", "cuisine", "menu", "chef"],
    "professional": ["lawyer", "accountant", "consultant", "attorney", "financial"],
    "home_services": ["plumber", "electrician", "hvac", "carpenter", "locksmith"],
    # ... add all 12 categories
}

def classify_business(category: str, website_text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Classify business type from category field and website content.
    Returns: {
        "primary_type": "restaurant",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "secondary_tags": ["italian", "fine_dining"]
    }
    """
    # Implementation: keyword matching + scoring
    pass
```

**Step 3: Create Niche Design Config** (Priority #2)
```yaml
# File: backend/app/config/niche_designs.yaml
# Use the complete morphological analysis matrix from this document
# Include: colors, typography, hero styles, CTAs, sections, animations
```

**Step 4: Enhance Media Sourcing** (Priority #3)
```python
# File: backend/app/services/media_query_builder.py

def build_image_queries(business_type: str, section: str, location: str = None) -> list:
    """
    Generate optimized search queries for Unsplash/Pexels.
    Returns list of search terms prioritized by relevance.
    """
    # Use media asset strategy from morphological analysis
    pass
```

**Step 5: Update Premium Generator**
```python
# File: backend/app/services/template_generator_premium.py

# Add at the beginning of generate_templates_for_business():
from app.services.business_classifier import classify_business
from app.config import niche_designs  # Load YAML config

# Classify business type
business_type_info = classify_business(
    category=business.category,
    website_text=scraped_content
)

# Load niche-specific design rules
design_rules = niche_designs[business_type_info["primary_type"]]

# Use design_rules throughout template generation
# Example: colors = design_rules["primary_colors"]
#          cta_text = design_rules["primary_cta"]
#          sections = design_rules["required_sections"]
```
