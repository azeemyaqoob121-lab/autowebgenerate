You are a senior UI/UX developer and creative web designer. 
Generate complete HTML5 website template for the following business:

BUSINESS DETAILS:
- Business Name: [BUSINESS_NAME]
- Industry / Category: [INDUSTRY]
- Location: [LOCATION]
- Contact: [PHONE], [EMAIL]
- Address: [FULL_ADDRESS]
- Description / Services: [BUSINESS_DESCRIPTION]
- Current Website Problems: [PROBLEM_LIST]

🎨 DESIGN GOAL:
Create a **modern, premium-quality, professional website** that looks like it cost over $100,000 to design — responsive, animated, and visually stunning.  
Use design principles similar to Apple, Notion, and Stripe websites — smooth motion, elegance, minimalism, and storytelling flow.

🔧 TECHNICAL & VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Produce ONE single HTML5 file (from `<!DOCTYPE html>` to `</html>`).
- All CSS must be inside `<style>` tags in the `<head>`.
- All JavaScript must be inside `<script>` tags at the end of `<body>`.
- Use **semantic HTML5 structure** with comments explaining each section.
- Use **Poppins** for headlines, **Inter** for body text, **Playfair Display** for accents.
- Include fallback fonts in case Google Fonts cannot load.

⚡ PERFORMANCE:
- Lazy-load all images using `<img loading="lazy">`
- Use `will-change` for animations.
- Use lightweight vanilla JS (no frameworks).
- Use CSS variables for colors.
- Optimize animations for 60fps using requestAnimationFrame.

📱 RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
- Mobile-first layout that adapts perfectly to all screen sizes.
- Smooth mobile menu animation (hamburger → overlay).
- Touch-friendly buttons and links.

💫 VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- **Hero Section:** Full-screen hero with gradient/particle background and parallax image or video layer.
- **Icons:** Use inline SVG icons or emoji-style placeholders that match the business type (e.g. wrench for repair, chef hat for restaurant).
- **Images:** Use `<picture>` with sample placeholder images that visually represent the business. Add comment placeholders for replacement.
- **Animations:** Use CSS + JavaScript for:
  - Floating shapes or particles in hero
  - Scroll-triggered fade/slide animations
  - Hover transformations (e.g. 3D tilt)
  - Animated gradient text on hero titles
- **Custom Cursor:** Add optional custom cursor for desktop.

🧩 CONTENT STRUCTURE:
1. **Navigation (Glassmorphism style)** — semi-transparent, blurred, sticky on scroll.
2. **Hero Section** — business headline, short tagline, main CTA buttons (Call / Contact / Get Quote).
3. **About / Services Section** — highlight services with animated SVG icons.
4. **Why Choose Us** — 3D tilt cards showing features/advantages.
5. **Statistics Section** — animated counters (JS count-up on scroll).
6. **Testimonials** — auto-rotating carousel (JS only, accessible).
7. **Contact Section** — form with real-time validation, success/error states, and clickable phone/email links.
8. **Footer** — social icons, address, copyright.

🎯 CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION:
- Prominent CTAs (“Get Free Quote”, “Call Now”)
- Trust elements (stars, badges, client logos)
- Testimonials as social proof
- Urgency cues (“Limited Slots”, “Book Today”)

🔍 SEO & META:
- Proper `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`
- Open Graph and Twitter meta tags (placeholders)
- Schema.org JSON-LD for LocalBusiness

🌈 STYLE:
- Light + subtle gradient background
- Soft shadows, glassmorphism layers
- Smooth fade-in + parallax motion
- Color scheme should match the business category automatically 
- Include subtle Lottie-like icon animations (CSS or JS).

🧠 INTERACTION:
- Scroll-triggered animations using IntersectionObserver.
- Tilt effect on cards using mouse position (desktop) and soft tap movement (mobile).
- Form validation (HTML + JS) — show green/red states.
- Animated loading overlay on page load (brief and smooth).

🚀 OUTPUT:
- Generate one clean, production-ready HTML file.
- Add comments in the code showing where to replace:
  - Fonts
  - Images
  - Analytics
  - Form endpoints
- The file must be **copy-paste runnable** in a browser with all effects working locally.

📝 AT END OF HTML:
Add developer notes (inside HTML comments):
- Where to replace images, fonts, analytics, and endpoint URLs.
- Where to tune animation intensity for mobile.
- Accessibility considerations (keyboard nav, ARIA).
- Performance tips (reduce particle count, etc.)

Now generate the **complete HTML5 file** with:
- Stunning visuals,
- Animated icons and images,
- Smooth transitions,
- Fully responsive design,
- Interactive elements,
- SEO-friendly structure,
- And realistic business information inserted dynamically based on provided data.
